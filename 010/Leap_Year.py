 # Leap Year
# Write a program that returns True or False whether if a given year is a leap year.
# A normal year has 365 days, leap years have 366, with an extra day in February.
# This is how you work out whether if a particular year is a leap year.
# - on every year that is divisible by 4 with no remainder
# - except every year that is evenly divisible by 100 with no remainder
# - unless the year is also divisible by 400 with no remainder
